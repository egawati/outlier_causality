# Outlier Causality in Data Streams

This repo contains data stream simulators to find point outlier causality explanations (root causes) in data streams.
We propose Ocular and compare it to 4 exisiting algorithms: CausalRCA, CloudRanger, DyCause, and EasyRCA.
We conduct experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
